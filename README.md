# Green Stems

As we know maintaining a healthy garden is tough and needs a lot of care and nourishing to have good and healthy growth. Sometimes the early sign of any disease or anomaly in health is left unobserved, which leads to the death of those saplings. There is a need for early detection of any disease and medication. Also with the health circle, sometimes the identification of those saplings remains undone, leading to a lack of right remediation. So, there was a need for an overall app that can take care of all these needs.

So Green Stems is an application built with AI capabilities for disease detection, health detection, flower species identification and soil identification for better care and nourishment of our plants. You can either take a picture or load an image from the gallery and know the results of your scan. There is also has a page dedicated to gardening articles and blogs for the overall care of the plants and greenery that can help newbie gardeners kick-starting their gardening journey.

### Application developed by  [@jayesh-srivastava](https://github.com/jayesh-srivastava)
### Tflite models trained by  [@Sara-cos](https://github.com/Sara-cos) and [@mansijain014](https://github.com/mansijain014)

### Note -
(The dataset is still not as accurate as it should be to predict every possible plant species. It will be improved and used to train the model to get the best results for all possible local plants found in the garden.
We're also planning to add a feature to connect with local peers for gardening sessions and meetups to build local communities to spread awareness.)
